# calculatorRedo

* When going through Neos calculator, we found that when pressing the equal button  and then starting another number input, it would append to the most previous calculation.  In order to fix this, we added stringNumber and operatorSaved to be an empty string and num1 and num2 to be = 0  <br>
* I like the table theme, it makes it feel as though the calcuator is on a table.  I suggest that you used a view hieght of 100 to make the background image extend to the bottom of the page.<br>
* I suggest that you add    overflow-x: hidden;  for the situation that a reviewers screen is smaller than yours which could result in a side to side scrolling bar.  This code in your css will make that hidden.
